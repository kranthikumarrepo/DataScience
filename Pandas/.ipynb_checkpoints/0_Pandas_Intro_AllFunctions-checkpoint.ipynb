    "- Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- It provides data structures and operations for working with numerical tables and time series.\n",
    "- The library is built on top of NumPy and is designed to work with tabular data, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
    "- <b>Update:-</b> We can upadte an individual value in Pandas Series by using normal indexing.\n",
    "- .\n",
    "- Here are some of the key features of Pandas:\n",
    "- .\n",
    "- Data Structures:\n",
    "- Pandas provides two main data structures:\n",
    "- <b>Series:</b> A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.\n",
    "- <b>DataFrame:</b> A two-dimensional table-like structure with labeled rows and columns.\n",
    "- .\n",
    "- Data Manipulation:\n",
    "- Pandas offers a wide range of functions for manipulating data, including:\n",
    "- Filtering, sorting, grouping, joining, merging, and reshaping data.\n",
    "- Handling missing data (represented as NaN, NA, or NaT).\n",
    "- Selecting specific columns and rows.\n",
    "- Renaming columns.\n",
    "- Aggregating and transforming data.\n",
    "- .\n",
    "- Data Input/Output:\n",
    "- Pandas supports reading and writing data from various formats, including:\n",
    "- CSV files, Excel files, Databases, HDF5 files.\n",
    "- .\n",
    "- Time Series Functionality:\n",
    "- Pandas provides tools for working with time series data, such as:\n",
    "- Generating date ranges.\n",
    "- Converting frequencies.\n",
    "- Calculating moving window statistics.\n",
    "- Shifting and lagging data.\n",
    "- .\n",
    "- Integration:\n",
    "- Pandas integrates well with other Python data science libraries, such as:\n",
    "- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow.\n",
    "- .\n",
    "- Pandas is widely used in various fields, including finance, neuroscience, economics, statistics, advertising, and web analytics. It is a powerful tool for data analysis, allowing users to clean, explore, and manipulate data efficiently."
