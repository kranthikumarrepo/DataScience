    "### Curse Of Dimensionality\n",
    "- Problem of having to train the model with more columns/features/dimensions out of which majority of the columns have no significant impact on the outcome(Prediction)\n",
    "- Features - Columns - Dimensions >>> All are same.\n",
    "- There would be optimal number of features to predict outcome, beyond that there is no use of having more features.\n",
    "- Even though there are many columns, there is no significant use in the model - this is called as curse of dimensionality\n",
    "- Reduce the number of features that really have impact on the model using Feature Extraction\n",
    "- DisAdvantages\n",
    "- - Higher dimension increases sparsity - this would increase the area of search.\n",
    "  - Performance decreases\n",
    "  - Computation increases.\n",
    "- Solution for Curse of dimensionality\n",
    "- - Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "  - A. Feature Selection - Col1, Col2, ... ColN >>> Take subset of the existing columns like Col2, Col3.\n",
    "  - - Using Forward Selection, Backword Elimation, Bi-direction elimination.\n",
    "  - B. Feature Extraction - Col1, Col2, ... ColN >>> Create completely new columns of existing columns like E1, E2, ... EN.\n",
    "  - - Using PCA, LDA, TSNE, etc."
